            I think the hardest thing I've learned is <code>map()</code> function. Because I'm used to using for loop in C++, so at first I just use for loops for every question. But then when Jack look at my work and say it can just be simply <code>map()</code>, I understand what it is about. And I know I really understand it when I can explain it to Chantakrak when helping him with his lab.

            I think I can understand all the materials so far. So because we've read about visualizations and doing javascript, I think we're getting to the point making visualization by javascript? How can we know what type the data is in on a website so we can use it or not?
